# SDP Group 10 Firmware Repo

## How to build and run

This project is heavily based off of the BareArduino Project [here](https://github.com/ladislas/Bare-Arduino-Project/). Please follow their install [instructions](https://github.com/ladislas/Bare-Arduino-Project/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

I've already configured the project's makefile for the SDP hardware, so just cd to src/firmware and run 'make' then when the arduino is connected run make upload and it should be fine.

## Accessing the Serial Port
For this the easiest way remains to use the built in arduino serial monitor. run 'ardunio' and press CTRL+SHIFT+M to bring it up.
